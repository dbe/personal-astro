  <h1>Traveljoy</h1>

  <p>I was hired by Traveljoy to optimize their travel agent facing website. The site ran very slow on certain views which contained large data tables.</p>
  <p>I was able to improve site load times by an order of magnitude, from about 10 seconds, to sub-second load times.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <p>ES6, Ruby on Rails, Optimization</p>
