  <h1>Touchpoints</h1>

  <p>I was hired by Touchpoints to create a scalable service which used various APIs to aggregate user data of the client's customers.</p>
  <p>The project was particularly interesting because the company had no tech employees, so the service had to be user friendly for non-technical people to use and manage.</p>
  <p>The main service was a hadoop cluster on Amazon EMR(elastic map reduce) which ran parallelized API query jobs. I used the Cascading framework on top of Hadoop. The service included automated data cleaning and reconciliation.</p>
  <p>I also created a web interface in Flask for employees to do manual data reconciliation and to manage running jobs.</p>
